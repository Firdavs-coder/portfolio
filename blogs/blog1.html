            <h2>My Journey: How It All Started</h2>
            <p class="blog-date">Published on February 6, 2026</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Looking back at how I got into tech, it feels like a wild ride. It all started when I was 14, back in <b>2020</b>. I didn't have some fancy mentor; I just had YouTube and a lot of curiosity. I started by copying HTML codes from videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SaidbekArislonov/featured">Saidbek Arislonov</a>. I got pretty good at HTML and CSS because I practiced so much I basically knew them by heart, but JavaScript? That was a nightmare at first. I just couldn't wrap my head around it until I found some Khan Academy videos and shifted my focus to Python with help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BotirZiyatov/videos">Botir Ziyatov</a> and <a href="https://python.sariq.dev/">Anvar Narzullayev</a>.</p>
            <br>

            <p>By <b>2021</b>, things took a weird but cool turn. A local government IT center didn't have a teacher, so they actually hired me—a teenager—to teach frontend and backend. I had students who were way older than me, even school teachers and medics! It was a bit surreal, but it taught me so much about explaining complex stuff simply. Around that time, I also started digging into Flutter because I wanted to build mobile apps.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>2022</b> was the year of "trying and failing." I tried to launch a taxi app for my region. Twice. It failed both times because I didn't have the money to keep it going. Instead of giving up, I pivot to Telegram bots. That worked! I got over 10,000 users and finally earned my first dollar online. I also spent a lot of time improving my English, eventually getting my IELTS and SAT scores ready for university apps.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>2023</b> was a massive year for me. I started building APIs and put them on RapidAPI just to see what would happen. To my surprise, people actually started paying for them. By now, I have been over 5,000 developers using my tools. I even built my own platform, FAPIhub, to monetize my APIs. Got IELTS, SAT, started college applications and all that hard work paid off with over $1 million in scholarship offers from various universities.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In <b>2024</b>, I did an internship at MagicAPI which was a huge learning curve. Believe it or not, I graduated from both the internship and high school on the very same day! Soon after, I moved to Europe to start my Bachelor's degree in CS in Hungary.</p>
            <br>

            <p>But <b>2025</b> was a reality check. My API business started to fail, and the apps I built—Tavi and CalVault—didn't really take off. I realized I was good at building things but terrible at marketing them. It was a tough pill to swallow, but it led me to join the EvoCampus program at EvoSoft.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Now in <b>2026</b>, I've finished that program and I'm ready for whatever comes next. It’s been a series of ups and downs, but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Coding isn't just about the syntax; it's about solving problems and moving forward even when things don't go as planned.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Anyway, thanks for reading my story! Here is a photo of me from my journey.</p>
